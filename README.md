# Lite-Compiler
This project implements a simplified compiler designed for the Formal Languages and Automata Theory course. It performs lexical and syntactical analysis on a custom language.

**Project Structure:**

compiler: The main executable generated after building the project.
lex.yy.cpp: The C++ source code for the lexical analyzer, generated by Flex.
parser.tab.cpp: The C++ source code for the parser, generated by Bison.
ASTNode.h: Header file defining the structure of the Abstract Syntax Tree nodes.
SymbolTable.h: Header file defining the symbol table for variable management.
test.txt: A sample input file containing source code to test the compiler's functionality.
Makefile: Automation script for compiling the project.

# Prerequisites

A Linux based environment is needed to run this project (such as WSL for Windows), with the following tools:
- G++
- Flex
- Bison
- Make

These can all be installed running the following commands:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install g++ flex bison make
```

# Building the project

The project includes a Makefile to automate the compilation process. Access the folder containing the Makefile and run the command: `make` in the console.

# Running the project

The project can be ran by using the following command: `./compiler test.txt` (test.txt is an example of the custom language and most of its accepted functionalities)
